// What the application itself is doing: is it up, is it being restarted, and
// is it running out of memory.
//

// wrote. Neither answers the question somebody actually arrives with — "it was
// fine yesterday and now it keeps dying" — and the three fields that do are
// here: readiness, restarts with the reason the last container ended, and
// memory against the limit it is measured against.
//
// Nothing here runs on load. app.js decides when an app is selected and calls
// mountMetrics; the two guards at the bottom are the ones logs.js already
// carries, because a browser has no module and node --test has no document.

// The panel decides nothing, and this file is where that rule earns its keep.

// interchangeable: a value, a cluster with no metrics-server in it, and a
// metrics-server that has no sample for these pods yet. The third is real —
// a container that is restarting faster than the scrape interval is never
// scraped — and it was found by running the endpoint against a crash-looping
// app, where every pod came back with no usage under a source that said it had
// answered. Rendered as "0" or as a blank cell, that finding disappears and the
// page says the application uses no memory.
//
// So the state is read off the response rather than inferred from the absence
// of a number, and each one gets a different screen: values, or per-pod "no
// sample yet" with the component still named, or no usage columns at all.
