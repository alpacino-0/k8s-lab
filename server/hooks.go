// # Why this endpoint is not in tenantRoutes
//
// It cannot be. Every route in that table lives under /api/v1/tenants/{tenant}
// and is admitted by the guard, which reads a session cookie. GitHub does not
// have one and never will: a webhook delivery is an anonymous POST from a
// machine that has never logged in, and there is no tenant in the path because
// the caller does not know which tenant it is posting to — the platform works
// that out from the repository the push names.
//
// So the identity here is the signature and not the session. The secret is
// shared between one repository's webhook and one placement, the payload is
// signed with it, and a delivery that does not verify is refused before
// anything is read out of it. That is a real identity check and it is the whole
// of one; what it is not is the guard, and the difference matters because
// TestEveryTenantRouteIsGuarded walks tenantRoutes and would pass this route by.
// This handler has a different signature from the ones in that table — no guard
// argument — so it cannot be added to it by accident, which is the only
// protection worth having against somebody putting it there to make the
// symmetry look right.
//
// # What it refuses to tell an unauthenticated caller
//
// A caller who has not proved anything must not be able to learn which
// repositories this install builds. So an unknown repository and a bad
// signature answer identically: the same status, the same body, and no branch
// between them that a clock could tell apart before the comparison. Anything
// else turns this into an endpoint for enumerating a competitor's deployments
// one repository name at a time.
