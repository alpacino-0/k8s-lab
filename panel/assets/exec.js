// fetch and a reader, and not EventSource — which is the opposite of the
// decision logs.js made, for two reasons that both point this way.
//
// The small one: EventSource only issues GET, and this endpoint is a POST
// because the command is a body rather than a query.
//
// The large one: EventSource reconnects, and reconnecting here would re-run the
// command. logs.js retries five times with backoff because a dropped log stream
// costs nothing to reopen — the lines are still there. A dropped exec stream is
// a command that has already run, possibly a migration, and asking for it again
// is asking for it twice. So this connects once, and when the connection breaks
// it says so instead of trying to be helpful.

// version of this file, and folding them is wrong in both directions: a
// migration that exits 1 ran and printed why, and a command refused because
// the pod is crash-looping never touched anything.
//
// "lost" exists because of what it must not look like. The output pane going
// quiet is exactly what a command that printed nothing looks like, and the
// difference is that this one may have changed the database. ingress-nginx
// closes a stream silent for 60 seconds; the server heartbeats inside that, so
