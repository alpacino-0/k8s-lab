// The settings endpoint: what an application is configured with, and the one
// door the product did not have.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// n8n does not install from the catalogue, and the reason is not a bug. Its
// template shares one token between two variables, the platform mints one value
// per variable, and there was no way for a person to type a value at all. The
// same absence keeps every application that needs a database address or an API
// key out of the catalogue. Coolify has a text box here; this had a refusal.
//
// # Where a value goes, and why there are two answers
//
// A literal is committed: it goes in the Workload's Env, in git, in the diff,
// and anyone who can read the repository can read it. A secret is not: the
// value is written straight into a Secret beside the workload and git carries
// only the name of the variable and which Secret it lives in.
//
// That split is decided in docs/KARARLAR.md (2026-09-04) and it is bought with
// something real. A value that is not in git has no history and no rollback,
// and if the Secret is deleted nothing puts it back — measured on 2026-09-02,
// a manifest comes back in about ten seconds and a directly written object does
// not come back at all. secretNote is that sentence, returned to whoever is
// about to type a value rather than left in a document.

// settingsSecretNote is what the panel prints beside a secret. It is returned
// rather than left to the page, so the control plane and the panel cannot end
// up telling a user two different things about the same value.
const settingsSecretNote = "This value is not in git. Git carries the name and which Secret it " +
	"lives in; the value itself is written straight into the cluster, so there is no " +
	"\"who changed it and when\" for it, no rollback, and if the Secret is deleted nothing " +
	"puts it back — unlike a manifest, which Argo CD restores in about ten seconds."

// buildNotConsumedWarning is returned for every build-time variable, because
// one is recorded and delivered nowhere.
//
// Measured rather than assumed: BuildSpec carries repo, revision, path, image,
// builder and resources, and no environment at all, and internal/controller's
// build job injects none. A setting that is stored and does nothing is the
// exact thing this endpoint exists to stop being invisible, so it says so in
// the same breath as accepting it.
const buildNotConsumedWarning = "build-time variables are recorded and nothing consumes them " +
	"yet: a Build carries no environment, so the value reaches no build. It is kept so the " +
	"setting survives until it does."

// envNamePattern is what envFrom will actually deliver.
//
// A Secret may hold a key like "my.key" and a workload may not read it: envFrom
// skips a key that is not a valid environment variable name, the pod starts,
// the variable is absent, and the only trace is an event nobody reads. Refused
