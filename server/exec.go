// # Why one command and not a terminal

// A browser terminal needs a terminal emulator, and the panel has no build

// grow one. Shipping xterm.js would cost this repository the property that
// its front end has one dependency tree, in exchange for interactivity that
// the case this was asked for does not need: "run a migration" is one command
// whose output you read.
//
// # Why it streams
//
// See execHeartbeat. The command runs whether or not the connection survives,
// so the design question is whether the caller finds out what it did.
//
// # Why this is not an evidence record
//
// It was the first thing tried, and it is wrong for a reason worth writing
// down rather than rediscovering. An evidence Record is a deploy: its Seq
// means "the 41st deploy of api/prod", its Source is a commit, its Image is
// what that commit shipped, and its Hash chains to the record before it so
// that Verify can walk one Ref and say the history is intact. An exec has
// none of those. It carries no commit and no image, it has no lifecycle to
// transition through, and nothing about it can be replayed or verified later
// — the container it touched is gone by the next sync.
//
// Appending one anyway would do two kinds of damage. It would make Seq stop
// counting deploys, so "the 41st deploy" becomes a number that includes the
// times somebody opened a shell. And it would put a link in the hash chain
// that Verify has to accept but cannot check, which is worse than not
// recording it: a chain whose links mean two different things is a chain that
// proves less than it appears to.
//
// So it is a log line — see the two slog calls in execWith — and that is a
// weaker record, honestly weaker. It is not queryable per tenant, it is not
// tamper-evident, and it is not exported with the rest. What it is not is a
// deploy record that lies about what it counts. A tenant-visible audit trail
// for actions that are not deploys is a second store and a real piece of
// work; this endpoint is the second caller that wants one (the first is
// member:invite), and when there is a third it should be built rather than
// borrowed from the chain.
