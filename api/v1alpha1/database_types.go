// Database is a data server this platform runs for one app environment:
// PostgreSQL, or Redis.
//
// # Why it is not a field on Workload
//
// The obvious shape is spec.database on the Workload, and it is the shape that
// loses data. Everything a Workload renders carries an owner reference to it,
// which is what makes `kubectl delete workload` clean up — and a StatefulSet's
// PersistentVolumeClaims would go the same way. Deleting an app would delete
// its database, permanently, through a cascade nobody typed.
//
// The lifecycles are genuinely different, which is the real reason rather than
// the consequence. An app is redeployed many times a day and its database
// outlives every one of those deploys; an app can be deleted and recreated
// against data that has to still be there. Two objects with different
// lifetimes do not belong in one.
//
// # What connects them
//
// The Workload names a Database by name in its own namespace, and nothing more
// — no owner reference in either direction. The Database publishes its
// credentials as a Secret, which the Workload already knows how to consume
// through envFrom. That is the whole coupling: a name and a Secret.
//
// Deliberately not a cross-namespace reference. A Secret readable from another
// namespace is a tenant boundary with a hole in it, and the namespace-per-tenant
// arrangement is what makes the reference safe without another check.
//
// # Why the platform runs it at all
//
// One replica, no failover, no connection pooler. That is a real limit and it
// is stated rather than implied: this is the database a small team gets for
// free without operating one, and it is not a managed service. An install that
// needs high availability points its apps at something else, which the same
// envFrom seam already allows.

	// inheriting the first one's sentence and the sentence was wrong.
	//
	// PostgreSQL breaks going *forward*: it will not start on a data directory
	// written by a newer major version, so a tag that moves is an outage on the
	// next pod restart, at a moment nothing connects to the change that caused
	// it.
	//
	// Redis breaks going *backward*, which is the other direction and a
	// different risk. Measured 2026-09-01 on one volume: redis:8.2.4 started on
	// a directory redis:7.4.10 had written and read the key back, and then
	// redis:7.4.10 refused the directory redis:8.2.4 had written —
	//
	//	# Can't handle RDB format version 15
	//	# Fatal error loading the DB, check server logs. Exiting.
	//
	// — and exited. So a floating Redis tag survives the upgrade and destroys
	// the way back from it: the roll-back an operator reaches for when the new
