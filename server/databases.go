// The claim budget, and why this endpoint states it rather than enforcing it.
//
// A tenant namespace is fenced at four persistent volume claims
// (internal/manifest/fence.go). A Database takes one for its data, and a second
// for its archives when backups are on — measured in the operator:
// databaseClaim is always rendered, desiredBackupClaim only when Backup is set,
// and the API refuses backups on redis outright. So two backed-up Postgres
// databases use the whole budget, and they share it with every application
// volume in the same namespace.
//
// It cannot predict the refusal, and that is three separate findings rather
// than one:
//
//   - The control plane may not look. Its ClusterRole grants pods, pods/log,
//     pods/exec, deployments, workloads and databases; it carries no rule for
//     persistentvolumeclaims and none for resourcequotas, so live usage is not
//     readable even in principle.
//   - Counting the committed manifests instead would undercount. placement.go
//     says a tenant "may put as many apps in one [namespace] as it likes", and
//     each app's manifests live in its own directory — so the one directory
//     this endpoint reads is not the namespace.
//   - The refusal does not happen during the request anyway. The write path is
//     git: this returns once a commit is pushed, and the quota is applied by
//     the API server when Argo CD syncs. gitwrite says it plainly where it
//     returns a pending record — "this package knows a commit was pushed and
//     nothing more".
//
// So the honest thing is a fact rather than a forecast: what this object will
// take, and what the ceiling is. The refusal, when it comes, arrives where
// every other rejected sync arrives.
