	// NetworkPolicy lets a build reach the internet and the registry and nothing

// ServiceAccount to grant it to, because there is no control plane running in
// the cluster to hold one. Checked rather than assumed — the repository has a
// Dockerfile.operator and no Dockerfile for cmd/damga, chart/values.yaml
// deploys `damga-app`, which CI builds with `context: ./app` (the demo), and
// docs/CONTROL-PLANE.md tells the reader to run the server as a binary on their
// machine.
//
// What this server does hold is read access, through clusterReader in
// manager.go, and that is out-of-cluster too: it exists so one page can show a
// database's last rehearsal. So the seam is left nil and the endpoint answers
// 501.

// Answering 501 rather than pretending is the same decision backupRoute makes
// when it has no cluster reader, and for the same reason: the empty answer and
// the missing capability read identically to whoever is looking at the page,
