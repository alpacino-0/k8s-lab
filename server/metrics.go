//
// It is a snapshot and not a time series, and that is a scope decision rather
// than a first version. History needs something that stores it, and the two
// candidates — Prometheus, or a table of our own — are both a second system to
// operate for a question this endpoint does not ask. Measured before choosing:
// scripts/install.sh installs neither Prometheus nor kube-state-metrics, and CI
// installs neither, so a time series would have been built on a component the
// product does not ship.
//
// It also carries no request rate and no latency. Those come from the
// application's own /metrics, which means the application has to expose one and
// something has to scrape it — a general observability platform, which
// docs/PLAN.md puts outside the boundary in as many words. What is inside it is
// the user seeing whether their own app is healthy, and the three things that
// answer that are here: is it up, is it being restarted, and is it running out
// of memory.
