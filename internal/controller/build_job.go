	// Measured 2026-09-01, the three-node kind cluster this repository runs,

	//

	//   no Multi-Attach, no Pending pod, no warning event at all
	//
	// So ReadWriteOnce does not serialise anything here. It is one *node*, not
	// one pod, and the scheduler co-locates the pods precisely because the
	// volume is node-bound — which turns the guard into its opposite: ten
	// builds writing one cache directory at once, silently, and a build queue
	// pinned to whichever node holds the volume. A corrupt cache from that
	// reads later as a broken build, and nothing in the ten pods' output says
	// where it came from.
	//
	// The registry has neither problem. Ten builds read one cache concurrently
	// because a pull is a read; two builds of the same repository finishing at
	// once push the same reference and the last writer wins, which costs the
	// loser's cache and nothing else. It puts no build on any particular node.
	// And it survives the pod, which is the whole point: the disk this job has
