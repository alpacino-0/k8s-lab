// restartRoute would replace an app's pods with the same image. It cannot, and
// it says so rather than doing something adjacent.
//
// # Why this is 501 and not a commit
//
// A restart is a change to the pod template. That is the whole mechanism:
// `kubectl rollout restart` writes an annotation into
// `.spec.template.metadata.annotations`, the Deployment controller sees a new
// pod template hash, and a new ReplicaSet replaces the old pods. A change
// anywhere else on the Deployment — including its own annotations — creates no
// ReplicaSet and restarts nothing.
//
// The only write path is git, so a restart would have to be a field on the
// Workload that reaches the pod template. Read in
// internal/controller/resources.go: it does not exist. The Deployment's
// ObjectMeta gets the platform's annotations (`withAnnotations(objectMeta(app),
// platformAnnotations(app))`), and the pod template's ObjectMeta is
// `metav1.ObjectMeta{Labels: labelsFor(app)}` — labels, and nothing else. The
// observer confirms the arrangement from the other side: it reads
// `damga.co/rollout` off the Deployment's own annotations, not off the template.
//
// The alternatives were considered and each is worse than an honest refusal:
//
//   - Writing a marker into spec.env. It reaches the pod template, and it is
//     not inert — it is an environment variable the application can read, and
//     it would stay in the manifest for ever.
//   - Scaling to zero and back. The CRD's floor is one replica, and it is an
//     outage rather than a restart.
//   - Deleting pods from the control plane. There is no such permission and
//     that is deliberate: cluster/control-plane.yaml grants read cluster-wide
//     and creates nothing in a tenant namespace. A platform that can delete a
//     tenant's pods is a platform whose compromise is a tenant's outage.
//
// What would make this work is one line in the operator: carry the platform's
// annotations onto the pod template as well as onto the Deployment, or give the
// Workload a field whose only job is to change the template. Both are in
// internal/controller, which this change does not own.
